    "identification": "The Alligator Gar is certainly one of the most distinctive freshwater species of fish. It can be distinguished from all other gars by the two rows of teeth in the upper jaw, its broader snout, and its size when fully grown. All other gars have one row of teeth in the upper jaw. In most other respects all gars are very similar in appearance, with a long body, a long, toothy snout, and a single dorsal fin that is far back on the body above the anal fin and just before the tail.\nThe tail is  rounded and pectoral, ventral, and anal fins are fairly evenly spaced on the lower half of the body. The gars most closely resemble the fishes of the pike family (muskellunge, northern pike, and the pickerels.) in body shape and fin placement. In the pike family, the tail is forked not rounded.\n",

The surest way to distinguish this fish from the brown or yellow bullheads is by the pectoral fins. In the brown and yellow bullheads the rear edge of the pectoral fin spine is serrated with numerous sharp tooth-like projections, while the black bullhead the serrations are extremely weak or absent altogether. Also, the black bullhead has dark-colored chin barbels which may be gray, black, or black-spotted, and its body and head are deeper and more massive than in the brown or yellow bullheads. The tail fin is squarish (truncate) or slightly emarginate, which will readily distinguish the black bullhead from the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), the white catfish (Ameiurus catus), and the blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), all of which have deeply forked tails.",

In the black crappie the spots are irregular and scattered while in the white crappie the spots may be more vague and are clearly arranged into 7-9 vertical bars on the sides. Another distinction; the black crappie has 7-8 dorsal spines while the white crappie has only 6, the same number as in its anal fin.

It is only noticeably scarce in a swathe of the Midwest stretching from western Texas up through Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and western Montana, and even these states have black crappies either along their borders or in limited internal areas.\nThe black crappie  inhabits large ponds and shallow areas of lakes, with sandy or muddy bottoms and usually in areas of abundant vegetation.

Its color is highly variable and many range from dark blue or bluish-purple to yellow, and in some cases, it may even appear to be clear or colorless.\nThe Bluegill usually has 6 to 8 vertical bars on the sides, which may or may not be prominent. The cover peaks into a broad, round flap that is black in color; however, it is not surrounded by a lighter colored trim as it is in some other sunfishes. You can easily identify a Bluegill because they have a small mouth and head that are typical of sunfish species and the pectoral fins are pointed.\n",

Coloration is not a dependable distinguishing characteristic with this species and it is important to observe other physical characteristics in order to make a positive identification. The brown bullhead and the yellow bullhead have sharp, tooth-like serrations along the rear edge of the pectoral spine, found at the top of the pectoral fin. The black bullhead lacks any such serrations or has only extremely weak serrations that are negligible by comparison.

The brown bullhead is frequently mottled while the yellow is never mottled and its chin barbels are yellow, buff, or pale pink in color (the upper barbels are light to dark brown).

In addition to the spotted specimens, some channel catfish may be entirely black dorsally (males during the spawning season), or dark blue without spots, or even uniformly light blue or silvery exactly like a blue catfish or white catfish.\nIn the latter cases, the species can be identified by the number of rays in the anal fin. White catfish have 19-23 rays, channel catfish have 24-30, and blue catfish have the longest anal fin with 30-36 rays. Internally, the channel catfish has two chambers in the swim bladder and the blue catfish has three.\n",

The only other gar that is known to occur within the Florida gar’s range is the longnose gar which is found throughout much of the eastern half of the United States, including Florida, at least as far south as Lake Okeechobee. The longnose gar, however, lacks spots on top of its head and its beak is 18-20 times as long as it is wide (at the narrowest point), while the Florida gar’s beak is probably less than 5 ½ times as long as it is wide.",

It is the only species of Salmonidae in which the parr marks on the sides typically remain prominent throughout life rather than disappearing at an early age. A red streak similar to that of a rainbow trout runs along the sides through the ten or so parr marks. The tail is golden yellow (as is most of the body) and is covered with large black spots that radiate outward toward the edge as in the rainbow, cutthroat, and some other closely related species. Usually the posterior part of the body is heavily spotted. The forward part of the body may have spots above the lateral line on the back and top of the head, but not always. The upper fins are golden yellow and heavily spotted. The lower fins are orangish or reddish with no spots. The dorsal fin and the ventral and anal fins have white tips (in some specimens) that are often separated from the rest of the fin by a broad black line. The sides of the head and throat are a blend of rosy red and golden yellow. When this species is brought down from its high altitude habitat and propagated at low altitudes, it loses its brilliant colors and becomes steely blue.",

      "description": "The golden trout is native only to the upper Kern River basin in Tulare and Kern Counties, California. This trout occurs in clear, cool waters at elevations higher than 6,890 ft. Despite its limited distribution, there are two recognized sub-species of golden trout: Oncorhynchus aguabonita aguabonita, which is confined to the south fork of the Kern River and Golden Trout Creek, and Oncorhynchus aguabonita gilberti, which is confined to the Main Kern and Little Kern Rivers. An area of warm water where the South Fork joins the Kern apparently serves as a natural barrier that keeps the two subspecies apart. Golden trout have been introduced to other areas, including the states of Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming, which have self-sustaining populations. It is believed that most of these populations have hybridized with the cutthroat trout. According to some fisheries scientists, most trout in the Kern River basin are also hybrids of recent origin and the only pure populations of golden trout are those limited to the headwater areas.

The body is typically grayish to brownish with white or nearly white spots which extend onto the dorsal, adipose, and caudal fins. There are no red, black or haloed spots of any kind. It has a more deeply forked tail than other chars, and several rows of strong basibranchial teeth which are weak, less numerous, or absent in other chars. It is very large char known to grow over 100 lb. (45 kg).It has been crossed with the brook trout to produce a hybrid known as the “splake” or “wendigo trout.” The hybrid lacks the deep fork in the tail and more closely resembles the brook trout in most respects. There are 65-85 pyloric caeca in the hybrid versus 93-208 in the lake trout and 23-55 in the brook trout.",

      "description": "The lake trout is found throughout most of Canada and well into Alaska as well as the Great Lakes and in sections of the western U.S. where it has been introduced. In the southern portions of its range, or where introduced south of its native range, it seeks out the cooler waters of deep lakes. In northern lakes it may occur in either shallow or deep water. The siscowet, one of three recognized subspecies, is found in Lake Superior at a depth of 300-600 ft. (91-183 m). It is called a fat by commercial fishermen because the flesh is exceedingly fat and oily compared to the other two subspecies. Of all the chars, it is the least tolerant of salt water and is the only freshwater fish ranging into the far north of Canada and Alaska that has apparently not crossed the Bering Strait. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

The mouth is subterminal and the snout protrudes beyond it. Because the head is small in relation to the length of the body, older fish may develop a hump behind the head; thus the name “humpback.” The lake whitefish has more pyloric caeca, 140-222, than either the round, with 50-130, or mountain lakefish which has 50-146.

The northern pike, by comparison, has light-colored, oblong spots against a darker body, and the chain pickerel has a unique chain-like pattern on the sides. The redfin and grass pickerels look much more like the musky in their markings, but they only grow to about 15 in. (38 cm) long. Another distinction occurs in the number of pores under the lower jaw.

In body shape the members of the pike group are all identical, but the northern pike can be distinguished from its relatives by three main features. Most noticeably the greenish or yellowish sides of the fish are covered with lighter colored oblong horizontal spots or streaks, whereas all other species have darker markings than the background color. The second distinction is the scale pattern on the gill cover and cheek. In the northern pike the cheek is fully scaled, but the bottom half of the gill cover is scaleless. In the larger muskellunge, both the bottom half of the gill cover and the bottom half of the cheek are fully scaled. The third distinctive feature is the number of pores under each side of the lower jaw; usually 5 in the northern pike (rarely 3,4, or 6 on one side), 6-9 in the muskellunge (rarely 5 or 10 on one side), and 4 in the smaller pickerels (occasionally 3 or 5 on one side only).",

The greatest concentrations of pumpkinseed sunfish are found in the northeastern region of the United States. They are rarely or never found in the south-central or southwestern United States.Groups of young pumpkinseed sunfish school close to shore in substantial numbers in shallow, protected areas but adults tend to travel in groups of 2-4 in slightly deeper yet still covered waters. Pumpkinseed sunfish are more likely than other sunfish to be found in moving water.This species of sunfish are active throughout the day, but will often rest at night near the bottom of the water column or in protected areas in rocks or near submerged logs. They sometimes show a preference for a home range and will remain close to particular areas of a pond or lake. Even when fish are captured and released into a different part of a pond or lake, a significant percentage of them will return to their original location.

The upper jaw reaches beyond the beginning of the eye, but not completely to the back of the eye. The two dorsal fins are clearly connected and the eyes are red.The rock bass is frequently confused with the warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), but it can be distinguished by the number of spines in front of the soft-rayed anal fin; 3 spines in the warmouth, but 6 in the rock bass.

The body of the mountain whitefish, though almost cylindrical, is slightly compressed compared to the round whitefish. Coloration of the round whitefish is basically silvery, but the back is sepia brown to almost bronze with a greenish tinge. The scales, particularly on the back are edged with black. The lower fins are an amber shade becoming slightly more orange at spawning. The adipose fin is usually brown spotted. The round whitefish differs from all other North American whitefish and ciscoes in having only one flap between the openings of the nostrils, instead of two.",

The red color of the eyes associates this species with the redeye and Suwannee bass at first glance however morphologically, it is more closely related to the spotted bass. The shoal bass differs from the spotted bass by the absence of teeth on its tongue. The shoal bass also has more lateral line scales (usually 67-81), more rows of scales above (usually 8-10) and below (usually 15-21) the lateral line, and more caudal peduncle scales than the spotted bass. The color pattern of adult shoal bass is characterized by the presence of 10-15 midlateral and 6 to 8 supralateral dark vertical bars along the sides. These bars, which are also present in juveniles, easily distinguish the shoal bass from spotted bass. The redeye bass has an oval to rectangular patch of teeth on the tongue, fewer lateral line scales and fewer scale rows above and below the lateral line.The coloration of the shoal bass is olive green to dark olive to almost black. A dusky to black blotch is present on the posterior portion of the opercula and another one right before the tail. Three diagonal dark lines are present laterally on the head. The iris is typically bright red. Some have been known to reach more than eight pounds with the average size typically ranging around one to three pounds.",

Their combined distribution extends throughout the Great Lakes region north to the Hudson Bay, east to Montreal and Vermont, and south to South Carolina and the extreme northern portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.

It is generally silvery in appearance, except for its bronze-toned or olive green back. The fins are either white or grayish or pale red, but they may appear bright red in netted fish because they hemorrhage easily.

From there it extends to Lake Superior, northwestward to just across the border into Alberta, Canada. In the U.S. it does not extend very far west or east of the Great Lakes, except in Georgia and the Carolinas where it occurs all the way to the coast. It occurs northwest of the Great Lakes through the lower two-thirds of Lake Winnipeg to as far north as central Manitoba and Saskatchewan.This species can be found in medium to large rivers throughout its range as well as deep ponds and lakes that have sand substrate. Unlike their cousin, the carp, they are intolerant of pollution or very turbid waters so they are an indicator species for good water quality.

A smallmouth's eyes are red or orangish. In young smallmouths, there is a distinctive band of orange at the base of the tail.

It is not as widespread as the largemouth bass.\nThey prefer deeper water than the largemouth and areas of clear, fast-flowing streams and pools with gravel/rubble bottom. In waters coinhabited by both smallmouth and largemouth, the largemouth bass will spawn a little earlier due to the fact that the shallower nesting sites they choose in protected areas with emergent vegetation warm to the optimum temperature sooner that the deeper, rockier sites chosen by the smallmouths.\nThe following list includes additional details on where to catch Smallmouth bass:\n",

The shape of the tail is also a combination of the brook trout’s square tail and the lake trout’s more lunate tail. The tail of the splake is not as deeply forked as that of the lake trout, and more closely resembles the slightly indented tail of the brook trout. In coloration and makings, the splake more closely resembles the brook trout. It can be positively identified by the number of pyloric caeca, the worm-like appendages on the intestinal tract right after the stomach. The brook trout, which is the smaller parent, has only 23-55 (usually less than 50) pyloric caeca, while the intermediate-sized hybrid has 65-85, and the lake trout, the larger parent, has 93-208 caeca (most often 120-180).",

    "identification": "Many anglers who catch a spotted bass believe they have caught a largemouth bass, undoubtedly because the coloration is similar, both having a greenish hue and a broad stripe of diamonds or blotches along the midline of the body. The spotted bass, like all black basses except the largemouth, has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin, its first and second dorsal fin are clearly connected, and its upper jaw bone does not extend back to or beyond the rear edge of the eyes. The spotted bass is also often confused with the smallmouth bass, but lacks the vertical bars that are present on the sides of the body in the smallmouth. The spotted bass also has all black spots below the lateral line (the rear edges of certain scales are black) unlike either the largemouth or the smallmouth. Juveniles of the species resemble the young of smallmouth bass in having a broad band of orange at the base of the tail, followed by a broad black band and white edge. Because of the difficulty in recognizing the species, it is probable that record-size specimens of spotted bass have gone unnoticed.The smallmouth bass is known to hybridize in nature with the spotted bass, which could make identification of some specimens where both species are known to occur, even more difficult. Where depth permits, it appears that spotted bass usually stay deeper than smallmouths. In one lake in the TVA system in Tennessee, spotted bass have been taken at depths of up to 100 feet. Smallmouth bass, on the other hand, were not caught below 60 feet, and largemouth bass were always caught near the surface.",

Striped bass can be distinguished from hybrids by the regularity of stripes while the hybrid usually has interrupted or broken stripes.\n",

Some migrate from North Carolina, Virginia, or Maryland to more northern climates in the summer and return when the summer season is over.\nThe species moves far upstream in rivers during spawning migrations. In some of these waters populations have become landlocked due to artificial impoundments that blocked their return to the sea.

In shallow water at night, the eyes glow eerily under lights, readily identifying these fishes even before they can be seen.\nThe sauger can be distinguished by the markings on their dorsal fins. The walleye’s dorsal fin may be streaked, blotched, or plain, but lacks any clear spots and there is a prominent blotch at the posterior edge. On the sauger, the fin is spotted and lacks any large blotch at the back edge.
